# java-sbt-project-template
## Basic sbt-project template for pure Java projects with JUnit tests

A simple project template to introduce Java developers to [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) projects.
Default build.sbt, sample java classes and JUnit tests are included as examples.

The template depends on [junit-interface](https://github.com/sbt/junit-interface) sbt plugin for running JUnit tests.
The plugin allows to use standard sbt syntax (like `sbt test`) to run the tests.

The work has been inspired by two great resources:
- [Beginning SBT - A Simple Java-Only Project with Eclipse](http://blog.jiffle.net/post/32451176640/beginning-sbt-a-simple-java-only-project-with)
- [Building Java Projects With Sbt](http://xerial.org/blog/2014/03/24/sbt/)
